dont expect the speediest updates, or any at all



follow this guide: https://ii0606226.github.io/gdrive-compendium/credentials to get a credentials,json and use this website: https://sphynxinatorx.github.io/freefoil/ to get a gdrive.token file and copy both of them to /switch/tinfoil
this wont work if you dont to that so be warned i guess

add with https://rb.gy/wspmy5 in file manager or the locations.conf file in /switch/tinfoil
